A python project using the Leap Motion API for image processing and gesture control. 

##Usage
* Clone the repo or download the zip.
* `cd` to the folder.
* run python LeapMouse.py
* The coordinates of the palm are used to move the mouse pointer around.
* A pinch indicates a click.
* If the ring finger and pinky are not extended, the script enters scrolling mode and tilting the palm scrolls up and down.
* HandStats.py uses matplotlib to plot characteristics like image histogram or hand coordinates.
* HandDetect.py uses the Leap Image API and OpenCV to detect hands by accessing images from the controller.
